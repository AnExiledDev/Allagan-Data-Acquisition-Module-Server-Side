# Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. A valid AllaganData.com account. (Register at AllaganData.com/Register and verify your email.)
2. The latest version of Reborn Buddy x64.

### Installing
1. Login on the AllaganData website.
2. Open the sidebar by clicking the icon at the top left and click Settings.
3. Click the download button to get the files, and keep that page open as you will need your API key later on.
4. Open your RebornBuddy file location and navigate to the Plugins folder.
5. Create a new folder called "ADAM" (without the quotes). The folder name must be all UPPERCASE.
6. Open the zip file you downloaded and extract the contents into the ADAM folder which should be located at YourRebornBuddyFolder/Plugins/ADAM/
7. In that folder right click "ADAM.dll" and select "Properties" at the bottom of the menu.
8. Check the bottom of the dialog that pops up and look for an Unblock DLL button. If it's there, click it then close the dialog.
9. Go ahead and start up RebornBuddy.
10. Go to the Plugins tab inside of RebornBuddy and locate the Allagan Data Acquisition Module plugin and click that.
11. Click on the Settings button.
12. A new window will popup with an input for an Auth Key. Go back to your Settings page on the ADAM site where you downloaded the ADAM files and copy your Auth Key there to your clipboard.
13. Go back to the settings window for ADAM and paste your Auth Key in the input field. Please make sure there is no space at the start or the end of the input field.
14. Click Save & Test Key then close the settings window.
15. Click the checkbox beside the Allagan Data Acquisition Module plugin entry to enable the plugin.
16. Close RebornBuddy and re-open it. This step is sometimes required to ensure there are no issues with ADAM after first install. 
17. Check the RebornBuddy log to ensure it shows a message saying ADAM has connected.
18. Navigate back to the ADAM site and open the sidebar and click on the Chat link.
19. Click on "Select Character" at the top right of the screen then select the name of your character.
20. Confirm that chat is now showing up. If it doesn't show right away, please wait a little bit, and also check the Buddy Log tab as that tab should always have information in it if the plugin is working correctly.
21. You're done! Enjoy ADAM and explore the web interface to see all the cool features you can use.
