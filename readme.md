The Allagan Data Aquisition Module is a plugin developed for RebornBuddy which pulls chat, character, inventory and other data from FFXIV and sends it to a webserver through a socket connection.

Message me here on GitHub for any support or questions you may have.

Unfortunately the database schema is currently lost, if I find it I will add it to the repo.
